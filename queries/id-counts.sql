/* BigQuery

Description: These DISTINCT ID counts for each dataset during the Prepare phase of the project to validate whether the datasets are reliable, original, comprehensive, current and cited (ROCCC)

Results: 14/18 datasets have 33 distinct IDs. Dataset 5 has 14 distinct IDs. Datasets 14 and 17 have 24 distinct IDs and dataset 18 has 8 disinct IDs. The low number of distinct IDs in dataset
(heartrate_seconds) and dataset 18 (weight_log_info) reflects the lack of uptake on these app features. We may surmise that there is room for opportunity to optimize these features for greater adoption and use.

For datasets with < 33 distinct IDs, queries were run to obtain list of these IDs and to confirm whether there are IDs that are not found in the full list of 33 users. No discrepancies identified. These queries are captured below.

Some additional COUNT queries are run through the daily datasets and these related observations are captured below.
